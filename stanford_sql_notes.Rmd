# Stanford SQL Course

This are personal notes about the SQL course offered by Stanford Lagunita.

The url of the course is https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/course/

```{python}
# Showing content of repo
# !ls
```

```{python}
# Importing neccessary libraries
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# Writting helper functions

db = 'colleges.db'

def run_query(q):
    with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn:
        return pd.read_sql(q, conn)

def run_command(c):
    with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn:
        conn.isolation_level = None
        conn.execute(c)

def show_tables():
    return run_query('''
    select *
    from sqlite_master
    where type in ('table', 'view')
    ''')

```

```{python}
# Showing tables
show_tables()
```

## Basic Select Statements

```{python}
# Example of the basic select statement

run_query('''
    select sID, sName, GPA
    from Student
    where GPA > 3.6
''')
```

```{python}
# Using a select statement to perform an inner join

run_query('''
    select sName, major
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# Using the 'distinct' keyword to get only unique results in the obtained relation

run_query('''
    select distinct sName, major
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# Use of the "and" operator to specify multiple conditions on a 'where' clause

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, decision
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
        and sizeHS < 1000
        and major = 'CS'
        and cname = 'Stanford';
''')
```

```{python}
# When performing joins is important to check any ambiguous column names

run_query('''
    select College.cName 
    from College, Apply
    where College.cName = Apply.cName
        and enrollment > 20000
        and major = 'CS'
''')
```

```{python}
# Joining three relations were table A is related to table B, and table B is related to table C

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, Apply.cName
    from Student, College, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID and Apply.cName = College.cName;
''')
```

```{python}
# Order the results of a query using the 'order by' clause and the 'desc'keyword

# When ordering by two different attributes, the first given will define the first sort
# and the second attribute will be applied afterwards
run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, Apply.cName
    from Student, College, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID and Apply.cName = College.cName
    order by sName desc, GPA
''')
```

```{python}
# The 'like' operator can be used inside a 'where' clause to select 

run_query('''
    select major, sID
    from Apply
    where major like '%eng%'
''')

```

```{python}
# On the select clause it's also possible to perform arithmetic operations

run_query('''
    select gpa * 100
    from Student;

''')
```

```{python}
# You can use aliases to rename any attribute on the resulting relation

run_query('''
    select gpa * 100 as upgraded_gpa
    from Student;

''')
```

## Table Variables and Set Operators

```{python}
# Table variables are simply aliases used on relations. This means that this aliases are 
# declared on the "from" statement.

run_query('''
    select S.sID, A.cName, enrollment
    from Student as S, College as C, Apply as A
    where A.sID = S.sID and A.cName = C.cName;
''')
```

```{python}
# The union operator (union) is used to stack two relations. Each relation might be a table or can also be the product
# of an statement

run_query('''
    select cName from College
    
    union
    
    select sName from Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# When performing unions, SQL will automatically delete the duplicates. To change this behaviour, you 
# can se the "all" keyword

run_query('''
    select cName from College
    
    union all
    
    select sName from Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# The intersect operator returns the rows that appear in two relations. 

run_query('''
    select sID from Apply where major = 'CS'
    
    intersect
    
    select sID from Apply where major = 'EE';
''')
```

```{python}
# The intersect operator don't add expressive power to the language,
# Any statement made with the intersect operator could also be performed with a self join

run_query('''
    select distinct A1.sID
    from Apply as A1, Apply as A2
    where A1.sID = A2.sID and A1.major = 'CS' and A2.major = 'EE'
''')
```

```{python}
# The except operator returns every row in a first relation that is not in a second relation

run_query('''
    select sID from Apply where major = 'CS'
    
    except
    
    select sID from Apply where major = 'EE'
''')
```

```{python}
# Again, the except operator don't add any expressive power to SQL
# The same query can be written using an inner join and which statements

run_query('''
    select distinct sID
    from Apply
    where Apply.major = 'CS' and sID not in 
        (select distinct A1.sID
            from Apply as A1, Apply as A2
            where A1.sID = A2.sID and A1.major = 'CS' and A2.major = 'EE')
''')
```

## Subqueries in the WHERE Clause


```{python}
# Subqueries can be used in conjunction with the "in" operator to check if which values are in another computed
# relation

run_query('''
    select sID, sName
    from Student
    where sID in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS');
''')
```

```{python}
# You can also write a query using "in" and "not in" operators to emmulate the way the except operator works

run_query('''
select distinct sID
from Apply
where sID in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS')
    and sID not in (select sID from Apply where major = 'EE')
''')
```

```{python}
# The "exists" operator is used to check if a subquery is empty or not
# Here, there is also a "correlated reference". This means that the inner query is accesing a value
# from the outter query

run_query('''
    select cName, state
    from College C1
    where exists (select * from College C2
                    where C2.state = C1.state and C2.cName != C1.cName);
''')

# This query is computing the subquery for each of the rows in the outer query, this is, for each college name
# SQL computes the relation of the colleges in the same state and with a different name. If there is at least one
# row in this relation, the statement will be evaluated as True
```

```{python}
# The "not exists" operator returns True when a Query is empty. This functionality can be used 
# to emmulate the selection of a max or min value

run_query('''
select cName
from College C1
where not exists (select *
                    from College C2
                    where C2.enrollment > C1.enrollment)
''')

# This query takes each college and compute a subquery that returns a relation containing Colleges with higher number of
# enrollments. If there is no college with a higher number of enrollments, then the current college is the one with
# the biggest enrollment
```

```{python}
# The "all" statement evaluates an inequality between a number and a relation made of numbers. If the inequality is
# true for all the cases when the number and the elements of the relation is compared, then True is returned.

run_query('''
select sName, GPA
from Student
where GPA >= all (select GPA from Student);
''')

# This query compares each of the GPA values against the list of all GPA's. If the current GPA is bigger or equal to all
# of them, the name of the student is returned, hence finding the student(s) with the higher GPA.

# NOTE: THE "all" OPERATOR DON'T EXIST IN SQL
```

```{python}
# The "any" statement also evaluates an inequality between a value and a relation, but this time the result returns True
# when the relations holds for at least one of the rows

run_query('''
    select Cname
    from College S1
    where not enrollment <= any (select enrollment from College S2
                                    where S2.cName != S1.cName);

''')

# NOTE: THE 'any' OPERATOR DON'T EXIST IN SQL
```

## Subqueries in FROM and SELECT

```{python}

```
