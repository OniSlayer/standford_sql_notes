# Stanford SQL Course

This are personal notes about the SQL course offered by Stanford Lagunita.

The url of the course is https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/SQL/SelfPaced/course/

```{python}
# Showing content of repo
# !ls
```

```{python}
# Importing neccessary libraries
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
```

```{python}
# Writting helper functions

db = 'colleges.db'

def run_query(q):
    with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn:
        return pd.read_sql(q, conn)

def run_command(c):
    with sqlite3.connect(db) as conn:
        conn.isolation_level = None
        conn.execute(c)

def show_tables():
    return run_query('''
    select *
    from sqlite_master
    where type in ('table', 'view')
    ''')

```

```{python}
# Showing tables
show_tables()
```

## Basic Select Statements

```{python}
# Example of the basic select statement

run_query('''
    select sID, sName, GPA
    from Student
    where GPA > 3.6
''')
```

```{python}
# Using a select statement to perform an inner join

run_query('''
    select sName, major
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# Using the 'distinct' keyword to get only unique results in the obtained relation

run_query('''
    select distinct sName, major
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# Use of the "and" operator to specify multiple conditions on a 'where' clause

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, decision
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
        and sizeHS < 1000
        and major = 'CS'
        and cname = 'Stanford';
''')
```

```{python}
# When performing joins is important to check any ambiguous column names

run_query('''
    select College.cName 
    from College, Apply
    where College.cName = Apply.cName
        and enrollment > 20000
        and major = 'CS'
''')
```

```{python}
# Joining three relations were table A is related to table B, and table B is related to table C

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, Apply.cName
    from Student, College, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID and Apply.cName = College.cName;
''')
```

```{python}
# Order the results of a query using the 'order by' clause and the 'desc'keyword

# When ordering by two different attributes, the first given will define the first sort
# and the second attribute will be applied afterwards
run_query('''
    select sName, GPA, Apply.cName
    from Student, College, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID and Apply.cName = College.cName
    order by sName desc, GPA
''')
```

```{python}
# The 'like' operator can be used inside a 'where' clause to select 

run_query('''
    select major, sID
    from Apply
    where major like '%eng%'
''')

```

```{python}
# On the select clause it's also possible to perform arithmetic operations

run_query('''
    select gpa * 100
    from Student;

''')
```

```{python}
# You can use aliases to rename any attribute on the resulting relation

run_query('''
    select gpa * 100 as upgraded_gpa
    from Student;

''')
```

## Table Variables and Set Operators

```{python}
# Table variables are simply aliases used on relations. This means that this aliases are 
# declared on the "from" statement.

run_query('''
    select S.sID, A.cName, enrollment
    from Student as S, College as C, Apply as A
    where A.sID = S.sID and A.cName = C.cName;
''')
```

```{python}
# The union operator (union) is used to stack two relations. Each relation might be a table or can also be the product
# of an statement

run_query('''
    select cName from College
    
    union
    
    select sName from Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# When performing unions, SQL will automatically delete the duplicates. To change this behaviour, you 
# can se the "all" keyword

run_query('''
    select cName from College
    
    union all
    
    select sName from Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# The intersect operator returns the rows that appear in two relations. 

run_query('''
    select sID from Apply where major = 'CS'
    
    intersect
    
    select sID from Apply where major = 'EE';
''')
```

```{python}
# The intersect operator don't add expressive power to the language,
# Any statement made with the intersect operator could also be performed with a self join

run_query('''
    select distinct A1.sID
    from Apply as A1, Apply as A2
    where A1.sID = A2.sID and A1.major = 'CS' and A2.major = 'EE'
''')
```

```{python}
# The except operator returns every row in a first relation that is not in a second relation

run_query('''
    select sID from Apply where major = 'CS'
    
    except
    
    select sID from Apply where major = 'EE'
''')
```

```{python}
# Again, the except operator don't add any expressive power to SQL
# The same query can be written using an inner join and which statements

run_query('''
    select distinct sID
    from Apply
    where Apply.major = 'CS' and sID not in 
        (select distinct A1.sID
            from Apply as A1, Apply as A2
            where A1.sID = A2.sID and A1.major = 'CS' and A2.major = 'EE')
''')
```

## Subqueries in the WHERE Clause


```{python}
# Subqueries can be used in conjunction with the "in" operator to check if which values are in another computed
# relation

run_query('''
    select sID, sName
    from Student
    where sID in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS');
''')
```

```{python}
# You can also write a query using "in" and "not in" operators to emmulate the way the except operator works

run_query('''
select distinct sID
from Apply
where sID in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS')
    and sID not in (select sID from Apply where major = 'EE')
''')
```

```{python}
# The "exists" operator is used to check if a subquery is empty or not
# Here, there is also a "correlated reference". This means that the inner query is accesing a value
# from the outter query

run_query('''
    select cName, state
    from College C1
    where exists (select * from College C2
                    where C2.state = C1.state and C2.cName != C1.cName);
''')

# This query is computing the subquery for each of the rows in the outer query, this is, for each college name
# SQL computes the relation of the colleges in the same state and with a different name. If there is at least one
# row in this relation, the statement will be evaluated as True
```

```{python}
# The "not exists" operator returns True when a Query is empty. This functionality can be used 
# to emmulate the selection of a max or min value

run_query('''
select cName
from College C1
where not exists (select *
                    from College C2
                    where C2.enrollment > C1.enrollment)
''')

# This query takes each college and compute a subquery that returns a relation containing Colleges with higher number of
# enrollments. If there is no college with a higher number of enrollments, then the current college is the one with
# the biggest enrollment
```

```{python}
# The "all" statement evaluates an inequality between a number and a relation made of numbers. If the inequality is
# true for all the cases when the number and the elements of the relation is compared, then True is returned.

run_query('''
select sName, GPA
from Student
where GPA >= all (select GPA from Student);
''')

# This query compares each of the GPA values against the list of all GPA's. If the current GPA is bigger or equal to all
# of them, the name of the student is returned, hence finding the student(s) with the higher GPA.

# NOTE: THE "all" OPERATOR DON'T EXIST IN SQL
```

```{python}
# The "any" statement also evaluates an inequality between a value and a relation, but this time the result returns True
# when the relations holds for at least one of the rows

run_query('''
    select Cname
    from College S1
    where not enrollment <= any (select enrollment from College S2
                                    where S2.cName != S1.cName);

''')

# NOTE: THE 'any' OPERATOR DON'T EXIST IN SQL
```

## Subqueries in FROM and SELECT

```{python}
# The subqueries on the FROM clause are used to avoid performing multiple calculations 

run_query('''
    select *
    from ( select sID, sName, GPA, GPA*(sizeHS /1000)as scaledGPA
        from Student) as G
    where abs(G.scaledGPA - GPA) > 1
''')
```

```{python}
# The subqueries on the SELECT clause are used to calculate a single value for each tupple of the 
# outer query using referenciation. 

run_query('''
    select cName, state,
        (select max(GPA)
        from Apply, Student
        where Apply.cName = College.cName) as GP
    from College
''')
```

## The join family of operators

```{python}
# The inner join is basically the same as the cartesian product and the 'where' clause together
# The only difference is the syntax (use of "on" instead of "where")

run_query('''
    select distinct cName, major
    from Student inner join Apply
    on Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# the default type of join is the inner join, so if no join is specified, the inner join will be 
# performed

run_query('''
    select distinct cName, major
    from Student join Apply
    on Student.sID = Apply.sID
''')
```

```{python}
# the 'on' clause can alse be used to specify other conditions that would be placed on a where statement
# otherwise

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA
    from Student join Apply
    on Student.sID = Apply.sID
    and sizeHS < 1000 and major = 'CS' and cName = 'Stanford';
''')
```

```{python}
# The natural join will automatically perform a join in the attributes of both tables that have the same name
# It will also automatically delete the repeated attribute (in this case the sID)
run_query('''
    select distinct *
    from Student natural join Apply;
''')
```

```{python}
# It's considered a good practice to perform natural joins specifying the attribute that will be used
# using the 'using' statement

run_query('''
    select sName, GPA
    from Student natural join Apply using(sID)
    where sizeHS < 1000 and major = 'CS' and cName = 'Stanford';
''')

# The SQLite engine don't suppor the 'using' operator on natural joins
```

```{python}
# The left join works as usual

run_query('''
    select sName, sID, major
    from Student
    left outer join Apply using(sID);
''')

# Note that SQLite will mark a None where there is no corresponding information on the right table
```

```{python}
# The outter joins could also be rewritter using the union operator 

run_query('''
    select sName, sID, major
    from Student
    natural join Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
    
    union all
    
    select sName, sID, Null
    from Student
    where sID not in (select sID from Apply)
''')

# Here, the students that do apply are the joined using the union operator with the students that don't appear
# on the Apply table (i.e. didn't apply to any college)
```

```{python}
# You could also use the natural type of join in conjuction with the left join
# This will automatically use the attributes with the same name to perform the left join

run_query('''
    select sName, sID, cName, major
    from Apply
    natural left outer join Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# The right join works in the same way as the left join

run_query('''
    select sName, sID, major
    from Student
    right outer join Apply using(sID);
''')

# Note. right joins are not supported
```

```{python}
# The full outer join also works, but is not supported on SQL

run_query('''
    select sName, sID, major
    from Student
    full outer join Apply using(sID);
''')
```

## Aggregation

```{python}
# Aggregation function can be computed over all of the values of a specified attribute
# Note that a single value is returned

run_query('''
    select avg(GPA)
    from Student;
''')
```

```{python}
# Aggregation functions can be used in conjunction with any other clause

run_query('''
    select min(GPA)
    from Student
    natural join Apply
    where major = 'CS';
''')
```

```{python}
# The count aggregate function can make use of the 'distinct' keyword to only count unique values in a relation

print(run_query('''
    select count(sID)
    from Apply
    where cName = 'Cornell';
'''))

print(run_query('''
    select count(distinct sID)
    from Apply
    where cName = 'Cornell';
'''))
```

```{python}
# Aggregate functions can be used to calculate differences between measures, each measure being
# filtered with a 'where' condition

run_query('''
    select CS.avgGPA - NonCS.avgGPA
    from 
    (select avg(gpa) as avgGPA
        from Student 
        where sID in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS')) as CS,
    (select avg(gpa) as avgGPA
        from Student
        where sID not in (select sID from Apply where major = 'CS')) as NonCS
''')

```

```{python}
# the 'group by' clause allows to make segmentations using the unique values of an attribute
# Groups can be used to compute aggregate funcitons on each one of them

run_query('''
    select cName, count(*)
    from Apply
    group by cName
''')
```

```{python}
# You can even specify multiple attributes to use for the groups. In this cases
# each unique pair will be used as a single group.

run_query('''
    select cName, major, min(GPA), max(GPA)
    from Student
    natural join Apply
    group by cName, major;
''')
```

```{python}
# The 'order by' clause can be used to order the result by an attribute or conjunction of 
# attributes. 

run_query('''
    select Student.sID, cName
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
    order by Student.sID;
''')

```

```{python}
# The 'desc' keyword can be used after ordering by an attribute to indicate that
# the sorting should be made in descending order

run_query('''
    select Student.sID, cName
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
    order by Student.sID desc;
''')
```

```{python}
# When using an aggregate function on one of the attributes of the returned relation and not using 
# the aggreate function in other attributes, SQL will return the last value of each group

run_query('''
    select max(GPA), major, sName
    from Apply, Student
    where Apply.sID = Student.sID
    group by major
''')

# Here the max(GPA) and major are correctly stating the max gpa of all the students that apply to each major,
# but the sName might not correspond to the GPA
```

```{python}
# The 'having' clause allows to apply filters (i.e. conditionals) on aggregate funcitons. This is because the 'having'
# clause is applied after the 'group by' clause (this means that the having conditional is being checked 
# agains each group and not to each tuple of the relation)

run_query('''
    select cName
    from apply
    group by cName
    having count(*) < 5;
''')

# In this query, the groups are made first and for each of the groups, the count function is ran. If the result for the
# particular group is bigger than 5, then the name of the college will be returned. 

```

```{python}
# Another example of using the 'group by' clause and the 'having'clause is

run_query('''
    select major
    from Student, Apply
    where Student.sID = Apply.sID
    group by major
    having max(GPA) < (select avg(GPA) from Student)
''')
```

## Null Values

```{python}
# Inserting two null values for demonstration purposes

run_command('''
    insert into Student values (432, 'Kevin', null, 1500), (321, 'Lori', null, 2500)
''')
```

```{python}
# The where clause can evaluate each condition to either true, false or unknown. When a condition is being 
# evaluated on a null value, then the resul will be 'unknown' and won't appear in the final relation

run_query('''
    select sName
    from Student
    where GPA > 3 or GPA <= 3
''')

# The rows having kevin and lori will be evaluated to 'unknown', therefore don't appear on the final relation
```

```{python}
# If the 'is null' operator is added, then lori and kevin will return a true and will appear
# in the relation

run_query('''
    select sName
    from Student
    where GPA > 3 or GPA <= 3 or GPA is null
''')
```

## Data Modification Statements

```{python}
# You can use the 'Insert Into' to insert tuples or whole relations into a table as long as the relation to insert has the
# same schema

run_command('''
    insert into College values ('Carnegie Mellon', 'PA', 11500);
''')
```

```{python}
# You can insert a whole table as long as it has the same schema. Constant values can be written with either
# null or between quotes

run_command('''
    insert into Apply
    select sID, 'Carnegie Mellon', 'CS', null
    from Student
    where sID not in (select sID from Apply);
''')
```

```{python}
# To delete tupples, you use the 'delete from' command. This command accepts the tupples to be deleted. 

run_command('''
    delete from Student
    where sID in
    (select sID
    from Apply
    group by sID
    having count(distinct major) > 2);
    
''')
```

```{python}
# To update tuples, you use the 'update' command and the 'set' clause. 
# The 'set' clause is used to specify the changes to be made to a tuple or tuples in a relation

run_command('''
    update Apply
    set decision = 'Y', major = 'economics'
    where cName = 'Carnegie Mellon'
        and sID in (select sID from Student where GPA < 3.6)
''')
```

```{python}

```
